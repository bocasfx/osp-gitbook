# About this Manual

This manual describes the Open Systems Pharmacology Suite. This includes
technical descriptions of the different software elements together with examples
and brief introductions to relevant scientific aspects including references for
further reading. Naturally, the science described is selected based on our
experience and judgment of relevance in the given context. Further, our
“philosophy” is largely reflected in the software platform, and, vice versa, the
software platform influences how we work and think.

The handbook is divided into the following parts:

**Part I**: “*Mechanistic modeling of pharmacokinetics and -dynamics*” provides a brief general introduction to the science of computational systems biology with a strong focus on mechanistic modeling of pharmacokinetics and –dynamics.

**Part II**: “*Open Systems Pharmacology Suite*” provides a brief overview of our software platform, its scope, and puts it into context with the science.

Thereafter, a technical description of the different software elements is presented starting with *PK-Sim*® focusing on physiologically-based pharmacokinetics in **Part III**: “*Working with PK-Sim*®”, followed by *MoBi*® focusing on model customization and extension as well as on pharmacodynamics in **Part IV**, “*Working with MoBi*®”.

Tools shared between *PK-Sim*® and *MoBi*® and some workflow examples are
presented in **Part V**, “*Shared Tools and Example Workflows*” .
After that, the interfaces to the common computing environments *Matlab*® and
*R* are described in **Part VI**, “*Working with Matlab® and R*” and Section 44.1, “*R Toolbox for MoBi*®”, respectively.
